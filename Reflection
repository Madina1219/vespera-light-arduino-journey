*What I Learned
.Iteration is not failure,itâ€™s progress.
.Sensors behave differently,calibration and delay are real factors
.Simplicity and clarity are key in connected environment design.
Reflection

*This project taught me:

.The importance of iteration over perfection
.How feedback and simplification lead to progress
.How data can represent real-world interactions meaningfully
.Even though I changed direction mid-project, each iteration brought new understanding of how connected systems sense, process, and respond.
