*Feedback Summary:
.When I presented my first sketch,the lecturer appreciated the creativity and ambition behind combining two lights (the plume light box and the Vespera) into one responsive system.
.However, I was advised to keep the interface simple because this was my first time building an IoT system and I was still learning the coding and MQTT communication basics.

*Duncan encouraged me to:
.Focus on understanding one sensor well (the PIR motion sensor) instead of trying to control two light outputs.
.Prioritise data flow and MQTT connectivity over building a complex interface.
.Ensure I could demonstrate a clear, working interaction during the short presentation time rather than multiple connected parts that might fail.

*My Reflection:
.At that point, I realised I was trying to do too much too soon.
.I was excited about creating something visually impressive,making both lights react together,without yet understanding the technical feasibility or timing challenges.

*This feedback helped me:
.Refocus on learning the basics of sensor input and MQTT output.
.Simplifying my design by choosing one sensor (the PIR) and one output (the Vespera).
.Understand that simplicity and clarity are more valuable at this stage than complexity.

*Action Taken After Feedback:
.Removed the plume light from my main prototype concept.
.Decided to repurpose only the box (as a physical casing for the Arduino) instead of wiring the light itself.
.Concentrated on getting the motion-to-light connection via MQTT working.

*Later, after testing and still facing calibration delays, I switched to a microphone sensor for a faster, simpler demonstration.

*Lesson Learned:
“Good design is not about doing more,it’s about doing the essential things well.”
This moment of feedback reshaped how I think about connected environments,it taught me that the core goal is understanding the data relationship between sensor, device, and network, before expanding to complex systems.
