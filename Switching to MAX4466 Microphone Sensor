.Decided to replace PIR with a MAX4466 microphone.
.I soldered the MAX4466 microphone to my Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 and uploaded a test sketch.
.simplified code, got faster response and tested code successfully.
.This new sensor detects knocking sounds and reacts instantly.
.The idea is to place Arduino in a Christmas house, and when I knock on the “door,” Vespera lights up. 
.The idea was that when the microphone sensed a loud knock, it would send a signal through WiFi to the MQTT broker, which would then trigger the Vespera light to turn blue-Red-Green
.I experimented with different threshold values in the code to make sure it reacted only to real knocks (not background noise), and the response time was as fast as possible.
.I also tested by tapping different surfaces to find the best sensitivity range.


*Observation
.The response was much faster than with the PIR sensor,almost immediate when a knock was detected.
.It was also more predictable with the configured knocks
.This made the system feel more interactive and engaging for the demo.
.Visually, it created the effect of “knocking on a door”, and the Vespera responding with a 'greeting light'.
.I placed the Arduino inside a Christmas house decoration, which became the symbolic “home” for the knock interaction.

*Reflection
.I also started to understand data thresholds, signal noise, and the importance of balancing speed and accuracy in sensor design.
.This phase gave me more confidence with coding adjustments and using the MQTT workflow, since the data flow was now easier to observe and test in real time.

*Next Step
.Finalise the Arduino code for the knock trigger,connect it to the MQTT broker, and demonstrate the data flow and Vespera response during my presentation.
