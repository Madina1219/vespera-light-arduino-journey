# vespera-light-arduino-journey
My first IoT prototype using Arduino, MQTT, and sensors
This repository documents my iterative journey in building my first IoT-connected environment prototype.
The aim was to connect a sensor to an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 and control a Vespera light device through an MQTT broker.
Over several weeks, I explored multiple prototypes,from a PIR motion sensor to a MAX4466 microphone knock sensor,and learned about how sensors, data, and feedback loops interact in connected systems.
