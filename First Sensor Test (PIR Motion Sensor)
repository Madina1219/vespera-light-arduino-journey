.Used PIR to detect detect presence in the lab and trigger Vespera via MQTT.
.During testing, I noticed that the PIR sensor took a long time to calibrate after powering on.
.Even after calibration, the motion detection felt delayed,it didn’t react immediately when I moved or moved my hands in front of it.
.I tried adjusting the code and some timing variables to make it more responsive, but I was still not getting the fast reaction I needed.
.Despite reuploading and testing several times, the sensor response stayed inconsistent.
.I realised the PIR sensor’s nature is to detect infrared changes (body heat movement) rather than instant gestures, which can naturally cause a short delay.

 * Reflection
.Because I only had two minutes to present my project on “Show and Tell” day, I felt that relying on a slower, unpredictable sensor could make my demo unreliable.
.I wanted to show an immediate, visible response between my sensor input and Vespera’s light output.
.That’s when I decided to move away from the PIR and look for a faster trigger method.
.I went back to all the assessment guides and understood that my goal at this stage was to demonstrate understanding, not complexity, and reliability mattered more than ambition.

*Lesson Learned
.Not all sensors respond at the same speed. PIR sensors need time to calibrate and can be sensitive to environment temperature and movement distance.
.Testing early helps identify performance issues before the final day.
.Sometimes, simplifying the system leads to a clearer and more successful demonstration.

*Next Step
.I chose to switch to a MAX4466 microphone sensor, which could detect knock sounds and send data instantly.
.This seemed a better option for my time-limited presentation, allowing me to demonstrate a quick and clear response.
